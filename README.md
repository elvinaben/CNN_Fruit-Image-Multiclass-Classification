# CNN_Fruit-Image-Multiclass-Classification
Fruit image multiclass classification using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

There are 4 fruit classes, including betel nut, banana, blackberry, and bitter gourd.

In this project, 2 architectures were used, namely VGG and EfficientNet.

From the evaluation, it was found that EfficientNet is more effective for the given dataset. 
The best model achieved an accuracy of 98%, and with a random sample of 40 images, the model successfully identified all images correctly.
